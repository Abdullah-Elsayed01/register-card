# Register-card

One of my recent projects that i worked on and it is a react project that works with form and registration, you will see the registration card right away when you open the app it will require you to add the information to sign up, 3 input filed each one has a certain requirements to accept the value such as in email you can't send the data if the value wasn't following the email addresses rolls fx: ``yourname@gmail.com``.

Right after that it will automatically transform you to the sign in section where it checks your data that you previously entered which in this case it is restored in the localstorage of your webpage.

You can see the app from [here](https://Abdullah-Elsayed01.github.io/register-card/)

Excited to see your opinions on the app.

Thank you, Abdullah
